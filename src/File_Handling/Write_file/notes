If you are just starting with Java, the easiest way to write text to a file is by using the FileWriter class.

Note: When you are done, you should close the writer with the close() method:



** Other Ways to Write to Files
There are several classes you can use to write files in Java:

FileWriter - easiest choice for basic text.
BufferedWriter - better for large text files, because it is faster and supports handy features.
FileOutputStream - best for binary data (images, audio, PDFs)
