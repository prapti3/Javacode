Data structures are ways to store and organize data so you can use it efficiently.

An array is an example of a data structure, which allows multiple elements to be stored in a single variable.

Java includes many other data structures as well, in the java.util package. Each is used to handle data in different ways.
Some of the most common are:

ArrayList
HashSet
HashMap
