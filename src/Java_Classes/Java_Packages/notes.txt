packages = used to group related classes.
=> folder in a file directory
=> used to avoid name conflict, write better maintainable code

** TYpes
1. build in

- Java API = library of prewritten classes
- free to use, includes JDE
- library contains components for managinig input, database programming, etc
- library is divided into
a. packages
b. classes

- means we can either import a single class (along with methods and attribtues)
- or complete package that contains all the classes that belong to specified package


ex = import package.name.Class;   // Import a single class
     import package.name.*;   // Import the whole package

     import java.util.Scanner;
     => java.util - package
     => Scanner - class of java.util package
     => create object of scanner class to use



2. user-defined
=> to create own package - understand that java uses file system directory to store them
