What is Debugging?
= Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in your code.

It often involves:

1. Reading error messages
2. Tracing variable values step by step
3. Testing small pieces of code independently


* Print Statements for Debugging

The most basic (and often most effective) way to debug Java code is to
use System.out.println() to print values and check the flow of the program.

* Debugging with IDEs
Modern IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and NetBeans come with built-in debugging tools.

Set breakpoints to pause the program at specific lines
Step through code line by line
Inspect variable values in real time



* Debugging Checklist
Read the full error message, it often tells you exactly what's wrong
Check if all variables are initialized before use
Print variable values to trace the problem
Watch for off-by-one errors in loops and arrays
Comment out sections of code to find bugs
