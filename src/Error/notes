Even experienced Java developers make mistakes.
The key is learning how to spot and fix them!


Types of Errors in Java

Error Type        	   Description
Compile-Time Error	   Detected by the compiler. Prevents code from running.
Runtime Error	       Occurs while the program is running. Often causes crashes.
Logical Error	       Code runs but gives incorrect results. Hardest to find.


Common Compile-Time Errors
Compile-time errors occur when the program cannot compile due to syntax or type issues.

1. Missing Semicolon = error: ';' expected
2. undeclared variables = cannot find symbol
                            symbol: variable myVar

3. Mismatched Types = incompatible types: String cannot be converted to int
ex . int x = "Hello";



Common Runtime Errors => Runtime errors occur when the program compiles but crashes or behaves unexpectedly.



1. Division by Zero = Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
2.  Array Index Out of Bounds = Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 8 out of bounds for length 3


Logical Errors = Logical errors happen when the code runs, but the result is not what you thought:
Logical Error: The code mistakenly subtracts instead of adds.
