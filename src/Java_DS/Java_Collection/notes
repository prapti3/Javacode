Before we explore ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, and other data structures in more detail, it's important to understand that all of these are part of something bigger - the Java Collections Framework.

The Java Collections Framework provides a set of interfaces (like List, Set, and Map) and a set of classes (ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, etc.) that implement those interfaces.

All of these are part of the java.util package.

They are used to store, search, sort, and organize data more easily - all using standardized methods and patterns.

** Core Interfaces in the Collections Framework
   Here are some common interfaces, along with their classes:

   Interface	Common Classes	Description
   List	ArrayList, LinkedList	Ordered collection that allows duplicates
   Set	HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet	Collection of unique elements
   Map	HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap	Stores key-value pairs with unique keys
