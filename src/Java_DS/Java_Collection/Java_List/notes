=> List interface is part of java collections framework
=> represents an ordered collection of elements

=> access elements by index, add duplicated and maintain order
=> list is interface, cannot create a list object directly

=> to use class that implements the list interface,
1. arraylist = resizable array with fast random access
2. linkedList = like a train of cars you can easily attach or remove
