*** Other Ways to Read Files
There are several classes you can use to read files in Java:

Scanner - best for simple text and when you want to parse numbers or words easily.
BufferedReader - best for large text files, because it is faster and reads line by line.
FileInputStream - best for binary data (images, audio, PDFs) or when you need full control of raw bytes.
